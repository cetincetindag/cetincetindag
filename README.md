### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Cetin Cetindag, born in 1997, Turkiye. Trying to reach true programming mastery before grim reaper shows up. Jazz piano player on the side, most probably my one and only hobby that I keep to this day.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning as much of anything as possible :D
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He / Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: C++ is not that bad after all...
